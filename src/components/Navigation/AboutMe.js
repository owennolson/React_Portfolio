          <p className="fs-4 text-color mb-4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2012, I have worked as a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) in various correctional facilities within local county jails in New Hampshire. Before pursuing my career as an LPN, I spent three years as a surgical technologist, gaining valuable experience in the operating room setting. I work well under pressure, I love to think critically, and most importantly I value learning and the search for knowledge. I love developing new skills and mastering new techniques regardless of what I set my mind to.

          <p className="fs-4 text-color">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a gaming enthusiast, and my love of computers is what has launched me into a career where I am able to create instead of just consuming. I love beekeeping - one of the most therapeutic things I have done in my life. I set my life to music, there's no situation where a song or a playlist can't be used. I love teamwork; my years in healthcare have taught me the importance of working well as a teammate, that a well-functioning team is priceless.
